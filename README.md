# WeatherApp

This is an iOS app for getting the current weather. The app gets your current location and displays the weather for your current location or you could set your location in the app settings. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap (http://openweathermap.org/) API to get the current weather and Google Places API (https://developers.google.com/places/) for the locations autocomplete in the settings view. You will need to specify the url and API keys in your Settings.plist file to get this app working.
